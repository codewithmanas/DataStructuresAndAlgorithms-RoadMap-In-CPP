In a computer, a data structure is a method of organizing and storing data in such a way that it can be accessed and used more efficiently. In addition to providing a way to manage large amounts of data, they provide a way for programmers to write algorithms that are able to operate efficiently on that data in a uniform manner.

It is important to note that there are many different types of data structures, such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. Depending on the specific use case, each of these has its own strengths and weaknesses.

A programmer's choice of the right data structure to solve a particular problem is one of the most crucial decisions he or she will have to make, as it can make a big difference to the program's performance and efficiency. It is a key part of computer science and programming to be able to understand data structures and their characteristics.
